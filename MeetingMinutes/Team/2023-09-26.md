## Topics Discussed
We discussed whether discord is a more viable meeting platform. We then began plotting possible meeting times for our client discovery meeting. We put together an email, with 3 possible time slots on Thursday (9/28), Friday (9/29), and Monday (10/2), mostly within business hours. We also used when2meet.com to figure out our collective availability in the future.

## Things Clarified
Next week, we plan to meet both on Tuesday and Thursday, likely on each day for at least 1 hour to knock out design details following our discovery meeting. We will be using discord for Team Meetings going forward. We will likely stick to Zoom for Client and potentially mentor meetings.
