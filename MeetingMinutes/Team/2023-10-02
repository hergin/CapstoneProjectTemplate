## Topics Discussed
We discussed the previous year’s peak-visualization GitHub project as well as our next-gen emotion computing project. We discussed questions to ask the client, as well as assign roles for note taking, screenshot taking, and potential diagram drawing. We discussed recording software as well as how to upload our video. We discussed who should talk and when as well as established some basic group dynamics when engaging with the client. By roughly 16:40, we were more or less fully prepped to tackle the client meeting.
## Things Clarified
We discussed that we would meet for roughly 10-15 minutes following our client meeting at 17:00-18:00 to compile our meeting notes and submit to the GitHub discovery folder.
